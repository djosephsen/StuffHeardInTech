## Cardinality
how much shit are we talking about? (eg. *high cardinality data* is a lot of
shit. The cardinality of the set of my fingers is 10, while the cardinality of
the set of bullshit mathematical jargon I'm willing to abuse to make myself
sound smarter is equal to the sum of all mathematical bullshit jargon that has
ever been invented in every language since the dawn of man.)
