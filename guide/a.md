#a

## Abstraction
The shit we use to make one kind of shit look and act like a different kind of shit. 

## Aperiodic
Shit that only happens every once in a while (eg not on a predictable schedule).

## Arbitrary
Some shit we just made up.
`you can't just insert arbitrary brackets and expect the parser to know what to do with them`

## Array
A numbered list of shit (as opposed to a [hash](h.md) (or sometimes [map](m.md)), both of
which are named lists of shit) eg if the [foo](f.md) array is: 
``` 
0: shit 
1: more shit 
2: even more shit
```
then foo[1] is `more shit`


## Asymmetrical
This shit doesn't match up. (eg in asymmetrical routing you might take a
different route *in* than the one you use to get *back* etc..)
