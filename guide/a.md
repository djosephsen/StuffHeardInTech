#a

## Arbitrary
Some shit we just made up.
/you can't just insert arbitrary brackets and expect the parser to know what to do with them/

## Abstraction
The shit we use to make one kind of shit look and act like a different kind of shit. 

## Aperiodic
Shit that only happens every once in a while

## Asymmetrical
Shit that doesn't match up; eg in asymmetrical routing you might take a different path in than the one you take back etc..
