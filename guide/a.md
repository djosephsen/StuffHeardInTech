#a

## Abstraction
The shit we use to make one kind of shit look and act like a different kind of shit. 

## Aperiodic
Shit that only happens every once in a while (eg not on a predictable schedule).

## Arbitrary
Some shit we just made up.
`you can't just insert arbitrary brackets and expect the parser to know what to do with them`

## Asymmetrical
This shit doesn't match up. (eg in asymmetrical routing you might take a
different route *in* than the one you use to get *back* etc..)
